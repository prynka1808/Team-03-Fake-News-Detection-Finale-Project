4eef62cfb587bbe69bdf3c234ac2f006,National Margarita Day 2025: Shake up your happy hour with these drink deals and a little bit of cocktail history,https://www.fastcompany.com/91281754/national-margarita-day-2025-best-deals-history-of-the-drink,['news'],,,"While Valentine’s Day and football get the majority of publicity during February, there’s more to this month than love and sports. You may want to consider changing up your typical happy-hour order this weekend to celebrate an unconventional holiday. Saturday, February 22, is National Margarita Day. This refreshing beverage has a long history of making those who imbibe forget their troubles for a while. Let’s take a look at the invention of the drink and some fun deals to take advantage of. What’s in a classic margarita anyway?While many variations of the beloved drink have popped up over the years, in its purest form, a margarita is comprised of tequila, lime juice, and Cointreau or Triple Sec. Traditionally served in a glass with a salted rim, its sweet, salty, and sour elements make for a delicious flavor combination to sip on.Who invented the margarita?There are conflicting stories about the creation of this cocktail. One version credits Carlos “Danny” Herrera. Necessity was the mother of invention in this version. In the late 1940s, Herrera, who owned the Tijuana, Mexico-area restaurant Rancho La Gloria, wanted to make something for customer Marjorie King. The young actress was allergic to all alcohol except tequila but didn’t like to drink the spirit straight.Never one to back down from a challenge, Herrera started experimenting and landed on the flavor combination we now know and love. He called the drink a Margarita (Spanish for Marjorie).Another story asserts that Margarita Sames is the real hero. This Dallas socialite claims to have created the drink while entertaining at her Acapulco vacation home in 1948.As this story goes, Tommy Hilton was one of her guests and liked it so much that he brought the drink to his hotels. But her claim is discredited in Anthony Dias Blue’s The Complete Book of Spirits, which states that the first importer of Jose Cuervo to the United States used the tagline, “Margarita: it’s more than a girl’s name,” in 1945.What are some deals for National Margarita Day?Chili’s Grill & Bar and Lifetime have teamed up for the big day. They released a 15-minute romantic comedy film starring Maria Menounos and Taye Diggs about a powerful big-city lawyer who comes back to her rural hometown for the holiday.You can stream it here, then head into the restaurant for $5 Tequila Trifectas at participating restaurants or a StrawEddy, the Margarita of the Month.If you find yourself in California, head to your local El Torito on Saturday. Participating restaurants in this Mexican chain are offering $10 Margarita Flights. Variety is the spice of life after all.Those in Atlanta can head to one of three Tin Lizzy Cantina locations. They are offering $6 House Margaritas and $8 Casa Noble Margaritas. TexMex chain Chuy’s is also offering drink specials.Finally, the New York Daily News has a roundup of Margarita Day deals in and around the Big Apple.However you celebrate the boozy holiday, make sure to say Salud!",ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAID PLANS,2025-02-22 11:01:00,UTC,"https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/w_1280,q_auto,f_auto,fl_lossy/f_webp,q_auto,c_fit/wp-cms-2/2025/02/p-91281754-natiopnal-margarita-day.jpg",fastcompany,3954,Fast Company,https://www.fastcompany.com,https://i.bytvi.com/domain_icons/fastcompany.png,english,['united states of america'],['top'],ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS,ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS,ONLY AVAILABLE IN PROFESSIONAL AND CORPORATE PLANS,ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS,ONLY AVAILABLE IN CORPORATE PLANS,False
