Finale Project Data Science Masters 

Machine Learning-powered Fake News Detection using NLP, BERT, and MLOps. Features automated data collection, model training, and real-time classification API

# üöÄ Project Overview
This project aims to build a **Machine Learning-powered Fake News Detection System** using **NLP, BERT, RoBERTa, and MLOps techniques**. The goal is to classify news articles as **real or fake**, automate data collection, and deploy a real-time API for news verification.

#üîç Features
Data Collection: Scrapes real-time news articles and uses labeled datasets.
Model Training: Fine-tunes transformer models (BERT, RoBERTa) for text classification.
MLOps Automation: Automates model training, evaluation, and deployment.
Real-time API: FastAPI-based REST API for fake news detection.
Deployment: Dockerized and cloud-ready.

# üìä Dataset
We use a combination of:
LIAR Dataset (Fact-checked statements)
FakeNewsNet (Labeled fake and real news)
Kaggle Fake News Dataset

# üõ† Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
ML Models: BERT, RoBERTa, Logistic Regression, SVM
Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-learn
MLOps Tools: MLflow, DVC, GitHub Actions, Docker
Deployment: FastAPI, AWS/GCP
